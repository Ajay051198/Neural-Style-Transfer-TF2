# Simple Neural Transfer using Tensorflow 2 

- This repo includes the code to perform a simple neural transfer algorithm on multiple images. 

- The implementation of neural style transfer was borrowed from Google Developers Tutorials. 

## How to use :

- Clone the repo: 

  `` git clone https://github.com/Ajay051198/Neural-Style-Transfer-TF2.git``

- Place content images in the content folder

- Place style images in style folder

- Run generate.py with python 

  ``` python generate.py```

The terminal should looking the following: 

<img src= "Capture.jpg">

- Once completed you can find your generated images in the style_transferred folder 

---

Result: 

Content: 

<img src = "content\vancouver.jpg">

<img src="style_transferred\vancouver_abstract.PNG">

<img src="style_transferred\vancouver_Starry_night.PNG">

Conclusion: 

The idea works, but a lot of refinement work is still required to produce better results
